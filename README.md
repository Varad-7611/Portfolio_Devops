## 🔄 How It Works

This website follows a **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** workflow using GitHub Actions and AWS S3.

1. You push changes (like HTML, CSS, or JS updates) to the **main branch** on GitHub.  
2. GitHub Actions automatically detects the update and starts the deployment process.  
3. The latest version of your website files is uploaded to the **AWS S3 bucket**.  
4. The S3 bucket is configured for **static website hosting**, making your website instantly available online.  
5. No manual upload is required — everything is handled automatically!

## ✅ Testing

To ensure your website deploys successfully:

1. Push any small change (like editing text in `index.html`) to the **main branch**.  
2. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository to see the deployment status.  
3. Once it shows **“Workflow completed successfully”**, open your live website link:  
   🔗 [http://git-hub-devops-1234.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com](http://git-hub-devops-1234.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com)  
4. Refresh the page — you should see your latest update live!
